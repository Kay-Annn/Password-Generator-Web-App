# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description
This web app features a password generator. It requires the user to input a length for the password that is between 8-128 characters. 

It also provides four additional criteria for the password. The options are: uppercase, lowercase, numeric and or special charaters. 

The user is prompted to make a selection if none of the four options are checked. 

**Please see alert pop on the following screenshot [Assets](./Assets/images/selectapasswordcriteria.png)**

There is also an additinal feature that removes the passwords after 30 seconds for additional security. 

**Please see timer at the following link [Assets](./Assets/images/timer%20for%20password%20to%20disappear.png)**

## What did I learn?
I learned how to use JavaScript to add functions to my HTML elements by calling elements by IDs and classes. I also learnt how to assignt variable to empty strings, to let them be equal to user's input, make them equal to results of a function. 

I learnt that in order to make a variable accessible to a function that is not within that same function, you have to declare it as a global variable.
